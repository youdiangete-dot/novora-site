# NOVORA Current Project State

## 1. Purpose

This document is the durable NOVORA project state ledger and the first file to
read before each new agent, stage, or implementation slice.

It exists because ChatGPT memory can become full, incomplete, or unavailable across future work sessions. GitHub documentation on `main` should be treated as the source of truth over chat memory whenever there is a conflict.

When chat memory, older local notes, detached worktree state, or assumptions
from previous conversations conflict with this ledger and the current GitHub
`main` branch, this ledger and current `main` win.

## 2. Current Production Baseline

- Domain: `novora.design` / `www.novora.design`
- Hosting: Vercel project `project-dd34e`
- Deployment baseline: the `main` branch deploys to Production
- Supabase project: `novora-production`
- Resend sending domain: `notify.novora.design`
- Admin email notification sender: `NOVORA <briefs@notify.novora.design>`

Do not include API keys, service role keys, admin access keys, provider tokens, or raw environment variable values in this document or future project-state ledger updates.

## 3. Core Completed Product Flow

- `/design/concept` collects guided design intake for a concept direction.
- `/design/brief` persists real Concept Brief submissions to Supabase.
- `/design/submitted` shows customer confirmation after submission.
- Final reference upload on `/design/brief` saves uploaded files to Supabase Storage and stores reference metadata in Supabase.
- `/admin/briefs` is protected by an admin access key and shows Supabase-backed submissions.
- `/admin/briefs/[publicReference]` shows protected submission detail.
- The protected Open reference route can open uploaded reference images.

## 4. Current Supabase Data And Storage State

Current Supabase tables:

- `concept_briefs` exists and stores real Concept Brief rows.
- `concept_brief_contacts` exists and stores contact rows.
- `concept_brief_reference_assets` exists and stores uploaded reference metadata.
- `admin_notes` exists and persists admin review status and internal notes.
- `concept_brief_notification_events` exists as of the Agent 24B-2 SQL execution.

Current Supabase Storage buckets:

- `novora-reference-images`
- `novora-ai-sketches`

The `concept_brief_notification_events` table has RLS enabled, a unique delivery index for durable notification idempotency, no `anon` or `authenticated` grants, and service-role-only `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `UPDATE` access.

## 5. Current Email Notification State

Agent 23A added admin notification plumbing.

Agent 23B verified the real Resend/Gmail email flow:

- no-image submission works
- one-image submission works
- the email includes the protected admin detail link
- image count is correct
- protected admin detail and Open reference work

Agent 24B-3 PR #62 was merged and adds the app-side durable idempotency guard:

- reserve before calling Resend
- normalize recipient email
- skip duplicates on Postgres `23505` unique violation
- mark notification events as `sent` or `failed`
- keep customer submission non-blocking

Agent 24D completed controlled Production idempotency verification after PR #62:

- one real test Concept Brief submission sent exactly one admin email
- repeating the admin notification route for the same `conceptBriefId` and `publicReference` did not send a second email
- the notification route returned the expected non-blocking duplicate/skipped result on repeat call
- Supabase contained one notification event row for the Concept Brief, notification type, and normalized recipient
- no new schema or SQL change was required during verification

PR #74 fixed an overly aggressive `/design/brief` client-side Concept Brief
submit timeout that could abort before a successful persisted response reached
the browser and thereby skip admin notification. Production smoke verification
after merge passed for test submission `NOVORA-CB-20260526-NWD8` (`Agent 26E-3D
Timeout Fix Smoke Test`): `/design/submitted` showed success, Gmail received the
admin notification email, and Supabase read-only verification found a
`concept_brief_notification_events` row with notification type
`admin_concept_brief_submitted`, status `sent`, and a Resend message id present.
This verification does not mean full public API abuse-control or rate-limit
provider enforcement is active.

PR #78 fixed Preview rate-limit enforcement and client-side 429 handling after
the rate-limit helper could increment Redis and then fail while interpreting the
Redis REST/EVAL response. Because the provider-error path failed open,
`/api/concept-briefs` could continue to Supabase persistence and return `201`
after the email counter exceeded the limit. The minimal patch made
`lib/server/public-api-rate-limit.ts` return and parse deterministic scalar
`count:ttl` output while keeping array compatibility, and updated
`app/design/brief/page.tsx` so intentional `429` responses keep the customer on
`/design/brief`, show a safe retry message, and do not fall through to local
submitted success. The focused Playwright regression
`keeps the customer on the brief page when the API returns rate limited`,
`npm.cmd run build`, `git diff --check`, and GitHub PR checks all passed before
merge.

Manual Preview verification after PR #78 merged passed on a Vercel Preview URL
under `project-dd34e-git-codex-preview-rate-limit-...vercel.app`, not
Production `novora.design`. Repeated synthetic submissions used
`preview-rate-limit-test@example.com`; the earlier Redis window had expired, the
email counter restarted, Upstash Data Browser first showed the email key value
`2` with active TTL, and additional same-email submissions succeeded until the
limit was reached. The over-limit submission `Preview Rate Limit Fix Test 12`
stayed on `/design/brief` instead of navigating to success, and the UI displayed
`Too many Concept Brief submission attempts.` followed by
`Please wait a few minutes before trying again.` Upstash then showed the email
key value `8` with about `14m 30s` TTL remaining. This confirms Preview calls
Upstash, the email counter exceeds the limit, intentional `429` handling is
user-safe, and the previous false-success behavior is fixed. Production
environment variables were not changed, Upstash settings were not changed,
Supabase/SQL/Resend/Cloudflare were not changed, and no real email was sent
during this verification.

## 7. Current Non-Goals And Boundaries

- No customer login system yet.
- No payment.
- No CAD approval workflow.
- No production order system.
- No customer confirmation email workflow.
- No real AI sketch generation API.
- No automatic retry tooling for failed or reserved admin notifications yet.
- A Concept Brief is not a final order, final pricing, CAD approval, or production confirmation.

## 8. Critical Product Constraints

- Do not add 10K Gold unless explicitly restored.
- Do not add 0.60mm+ machine-woven chain thickness unless explicitly restored.
- Keep chain options mainstream China-market procurable.
- Special or custom chain requirements should route to manual confirmation.
- Reference images selected on `/design/concept` are planning-only.
- Final real upload happens on `/design/brief`.
- Traditional Chinese and Taiwan should be included as future localization and market direction.

## 9. Operating Rules For Future Codex Work

- Start each new implementation from latest `main`.
- Use one feature branch per scoped task.
- Avoid broad rewrites.
- Do not expose secrets.
- Do not request API keys in chat.
- Do not do SQL, schema, grant, Supabase, Vercel, Resend, Cloudflare, or environment-variable work without explicit approval for that specific task.
- For docs-only tasks, no build is required unless code changes.
- For app-code tasks, run `npm run build` and focused tests.
- In permission dialogs, the user can click Continue or Allow; do not say "reply to Codex" inside permission dialogs.
- Read `docs/novora-codex-operating-mode.md` before changing workflow,
  branching, PR, deployment, permission, or agent-handoff rules.
- Do not run `git add .` without explicit approval for that exact command.
- Stop before app code, SQL, Supabase, Vercel, Resend, Cloudflare, real email,
  secrets, retry/resend behavior, payment, auth, CAD, order, AI generation,
  force push, PR merge, or Production deploy unless that specific action is
  explicitly approved.

## 10. Recommended Next Step

Recommended next step: review
`docs/novora-production-rate-limit-enablement-decision.md` before any
Production rate-limit environment/provider/deploy action. Treat Production
abuse-control enforcement as separate unless Preview provider setup is later
intentionally promoted or configured for Production. PR #78 has passed manual
Preview verification for Upstash-backed rate-limit enforcement and safe `429`
handling, but Production environment configuration was not changed. Do not
provision Vercel KV/Upstash, Turnstile, signing secrets, Vercel env values, or
implement additional rate-limit/bot-protection code until a separate approved
Agent/task.

Do not run SQL, change Supabase, change Vercel env, provision providers, create
secrets, or implement abuse-control code unless a separate reviewed Agent/task
explicitly approves that exact action.
